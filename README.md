## What is Merge Sort?

Merge Sort is an Array sorting algorithms. It is _generally_ known for being one of the fastest techniques.

In this algorithm:
1. The array is continuously split into half, with each half being split again and again until each half comprises of a single element.
2. Next, we continuously merge each list together:
  1. Lists are merged two at a time.
  2. Each element in the list is taken in order to create a single sorted list.
  3. The pattern continues until only a single sorted list remains and the sorting is complete.

## Features

- Built using a recursive algorithm

## Dependecies

- Python 3.6.9 (or higher)
